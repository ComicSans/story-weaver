# Story Weaver, draft 0.8

Story Weaver is a gamebook language written in Markdown. You write in a plain
text file that stays readable in any editor and on GitHub, and when you have
read this document you can write anything a Fighting Fantasy or Lone Wolf
volume needed. Keywords are English throughout.

## 1. Start here

### 1.1 What a gamebook is

A gamebook is a novel you play. Instead of reading page 2 after page 1, you
read a numbered section, reach a decision at the end of it, and turn to the
number your decision names. "If you open the door, turn to 137. If you walk
away, turn to 42." The reader's path through the book is their own, and no
two playthroughs need be the same.

The books this language is modelled on added dice to that. *Fighting Fantasy*
gave you three numbers rolled at the start, Skill, Stamina and Luck, and a
fight was resolved by rolling against them round after round. *Lone Wolf* gave
you a list of disciplines to choose from and code words to write down when
something happened, so that a book could ask two hundred sections later
whether you had been there. Story Weaver builds all of that in, so you write
the story and not the machinery underneath it.

### 1.2 What Story Weaver is

Story Weaver borrows from two places.

**Markdown** is the syntax. Markdown is the lightweight way of writing
formatted text that GitHub, Reddit and most note apps use: `#` starts a
heading, `*` starts a list item, `[text](target)` is a link. Story Weaver
gives those three spellings a job. A heading is a section of the gamebook, a
list item is a choice, and a link is the "turn to 137".

**ink** is the story logic. ink is the scripting language inkle wrote for
their own games (*80 Days*, *Heaven's Vault*, *Sorcery!*) and released for
everyone. It is very good at branching narrative, and Story Weaver keeps its
ideas while replacing its punctuation with Markdown's. You do not need to know
ink to read this document.

Here is a complete, playable book.

```markdown
---
title: The Door
start: hall
---

# The Hall {#hall}

Dust hangs in the light from the one high window. A door stands ajar to
the north, and the stairs behind you lead back out.

* [Push the door open](#door) The hinges give without a sound.
* [Take the stairs](#away)

# Beyond the Door {#door}

The room is smaller than the hall, and someone has been here recently.

-> away

# Back in the Daylight {#away}

You have had enough of the place. The gate closes behind you.

-> END
```

Three headings, three sections of the gamebook. Two list items in the first
one, so the reader picks. One arrow at the end of the second, so the story
moves on without asking. `-> END` in the third, so the book stops there. The
block at the top between the two `---` lines is the frontmatter, where a book
declares its settings. This one declares almost nothing, and section 7 is
where Skill, Stamina and Luck join it.

### 1.3 The words

| Term | What it means |
|---|---|
| **node** | One addressable section of the gamebook, written as a Markdown heading. The "137" a reader turns to. See 5.1. |
| **divert** | A jump from one node to another, written `-> name`. The "turn to 137" itself. See 5.2. |
| **choice** | A decision offered to the reader, written as a Markdown list item. See 5.3. |
| **once-only / sticky** | A once-only choice (`*`) disappears after it is taken; a sticky one (`+`) stays. See 5.3. |
| **gather** | The point where choices that branched come back together, written `---`. See 5.4. |
| **weave** | Choices nested inside choices that rejoin without leaving the node. ink's word, kept. See 5.3. |
| **glue** | `<>`, which joins two pieces of text into one paragraph across a choice. See 5.5. |
| **alternative** | Text that changes between visits, written `{like\|this}`. See 5.6. |
| **frontmatter** | The block of settings at the top of a file, between two `---` lines, written in YAML. See 7. |
| **YAML** | A plain-text format for settings, built from `key: value` lines and indentation. Used for the frontmatter and for `book.yaml`. See 7. |
| **stat** | A number on the character sheet, such as Skill or Gold. Declared in the frontmatter. See 7. |
| **variable** | Any value the book itself writes. Stats are variables. See 9. |
| **fact** | A value the book only ever reads, computed from state it does not own. See 9 and 10. |
| **host fact** | A fact whose value comes from outside the book, such as elapsed real time. See 10.4. |
| **derived fact** | A fact the book computes from other values with a formula. See 10.3. |
| **boundary** | The instant between one page and the next, when facts are computed and events run. See 11. |
| **event** | A rule that watches a condition at every boundary and changes state when it holds. See 12. |
| **place** | Somewhere the book can be, declared once in a table and addressed by index. See 13. |
| **check** | A dice roll compared against a stat, the "Test your Luck" of the old books. See 6. |
| **code word** | A word the reader notes down, which the book can ask about later. Lone Wolf's device. See 6. |
| **namespace** | The prefix that says which file a node id belongs to, in a book split across files. See 4.3. |
| **catalogue** | A translated file: the same text in another language, carrying no logic. See 4.4. |
| **seed** | The number the random stream starts from. The same seed replays the same dice. See 15. |
| **runtime** | The piece of code that actually plays a compiled book. See 20.1. |
| **host** | Whatever the runtime runs inside: a web page, a phone app, a terminal. See 10.4 for what it supplies a book, and 20.5 for what one has to write. |
| **story JSON** | What the compiler emits from your Markdown. See 17.1. |
| **save JSON** | One reader's playthrough, as a single JSON object. See 15. |
| **episode** | A book played as one passage inside a larger program rather than start to finish. See 20.6. |
| **linter** | The checker that points at what is probably a mistake without refusing to compile. See 19. |

### 1.4 The road ahead

The document is in six parts.

**Sections 2 to 4 set the ground.** The nine principles the language is built
on, what it keeps from ink and what it replaces, and how a project is laid out
on disk.

**Sections 5 to 8 are the language you write.** The narrative text, the
built-in functions, the character sheet, and combat. If you only ever write
books that stay inside their own covers, these four sections and section 14
are all you need.

**Sections 9 to 13 add the world outside the book.** Facts, boundaries, events
and places let a story ask about things it does not own: what time it is,
where the reader is, what the weather did. A book that needs none of this is a
complete book, so this part can be read late or not at all.

**Section 14 is a whole small book**, annotated line by line.

**Sections 15 to 19 are for people building tools**: how a game is saved, what
the two JSON formats hold, and how the parser and the linter work. Section 20
says what each version added.

Exporting a book, embedding it in a program and the protocol a host speaks are
not here. They are in `HOSTS.md`, and an author needs none of it.

A code like `E040` is a compile error:
the compiler refuses the book and says why. A code like `L005` is a lint
warning: the book compiles, and a separate checker points at what is probably
a mistake. Every error code is listed in 18.3 and every warning in 19. When a rule below
ends in a code, that code is the thing you will actually see on your screen when you
break it.

## 2. Principles

Nine principles shape everything that follows. Each returns in a later
section, so the short version is enough here.

1. **Where Markdown already has a spelling, use it.** A heading is a node,
   one addressable passage of the story, like a numbered section in a printed
   gamebook. A link is a divert, the jump that sends the reader to another
   node. A list item is a choice.
2. **One concept, one spelling.** Where ink offers three ways to do a thing,
   one survives. Where a character carries several meanings, one survives.
   You never have to guess which variant an author meant.
3. **Declare in the frontmatter, narrate in the text.** The frontmatter is
   the block at the top of a file where a book declares its setup. Everything
   below it is story. No configuration in the middle of prose.
4. **State is a flat object.** No call stack in the save. A save is JSON you
   can read and, if it comes to it, repair by hand.
5. **Randomness is reproducible.** Seed plus counter in the save. Load the
   same save twice and the dice fall the same way.
6. **The export is one file, plus the images a book links to.** No framework,
   no network access at runtime: an image is a relative path next to the
   export, never a URL. A book without images stays a single file, which is
   the case the target size in section 20 is written for.
7. **The book holds no time.** A clock is a variable a book declares and
   advances itself. The runtime never interprets its unit. Turn-based and
   real-time books are the same engine with a different thing feeding the
   clock.
8. **A fact is a pure function of its state.** A fact is a value the runtime
   computes for the book. Same state, same value, today and in a year. A fact
   never reads a clock, never draws a random number, never remembers anything
   between calls, and never reaches outside the state it is given.
9. **Facts are read-only to the book.** The story chooses where and when to
   look, and reality supplies the value. What the reader changes is a variable,
   not a fact.

Section 9 writes out the test that separates a fact from a variable, which is
where principles 7 to 9 stop being abstract.

Choosing Markdown has a price. The official
`inklecate` compiler cannot check these files, and the ink documentation
applies only by analogy. Our compiler is the only authority, so it needs
precise errors with line numbers and a test suite from day one. Sections 18
and 19 exist for that reason.

## 3. What makes ink dense, and what replaces it

ink is a fine language, but three of its habits make it hard to read cold. You
do not need to know ink to follow along. Each point below starts with the ink
habit and ends with the simpler rule you actually write.

- **`{ }` carries six meanings** in ink: print a variable, alternatives,
  conditional text, if/else, switch, visit counts. Which one applies is
  decided by a character far inside the braces, so you read to the middle
  before you know what you are looking at.
  Here: printing, alternatives and conditional text stay inline, and branching is
  an indented block. Switch is gone. Section 5.7 states the disambiguation
  rule that makes this decidable in one pass, for the compiler and for you.
- **Four kinds of divert** (`->`, `-> x ->`, `->->`, `<-`) that look alike and
  behave very differently. A divert is the jump that moves the story to
  another passage. Here: one divert, one arrow.
- **`[...]` inside a choice** splits button text from follow-on text, at three
  possible positions with three different results. Here: the link text is the
  button, everything after the link is follow-on text. One rule, no cases.

## 4. Project layout and imports

A book takes one of two shapes, one file for a short story or a folder of
files for a longer one. You can start small and grow later.

### 4.1 Single file

The simplest book is a single `.md` file. At the very top sits the YAML
frontmatter, a small block of settings between two `---` lines. Below it, the
story begins.

**A single-file book has no namespace.** A namespace is a prefix that says
which file an id belongs to, and with only one file there is nothing to tell
apart. So ids stay bare everywhere: in diverts, in `start:`, in `death.goto`,
in `visits()` and in the `node` and `visits` fields of a save. A dot in a
reference is an error there (E040). If you add a second file later, you will
qualify your references, a mechanical rewrite the linter can point at, and that
moment is why `as:` exists in 4.2.

### 4.2 Multi-file project

When your book grows, you split it into chapters:

```
my-book/
  book.yaml         # everything the frontmatter would hold
  start.md
  forest.md
  crypt.md
```

`book.yaml` replaces the frontmatter. It carries the declarations of section 7
plus the file list:

```yaml
title: The Thornwood
version: 1.4.0
start: start.begin          # qualified id of the first node
chapters:
  - start.md
  - forest.md
  - crypt.md
  - file: appendix/bestiary.md
    as: beast               # namespace override
```

Chapter files may carry their own frontmatter, but only `title:`. The
namespace is set in `book.yaml` and nowhere else, because `book.yaml` already
owns the file list, and `namespace:` in a chapter file is E011. Declarations that
affect the whole book (stats, inventory, items, combat, enemies, setup,
death, undo, strings)
belong in `book.yaml` and are an error anywhere else (E012). The reason is
principle 3: one place to look. `facts:`, `events:` and `places:` (10, 12, 13)
are book-wide in exactly the same way, and E012 rejects them in a chapter file
like the rest.

`start:` is optional and defaults to the first node of the first chapter. So a
book that begins at the beginning does not have to say so.

### 4.3 Namespaces and references

Every file in a multi-file project is a namespace, named after the file without
its extension (`crypt.md` becomes `crypt`), lowercased, with spaces, slashes
and dots replaced by hyphens. Or you pick your own name with `as:` in the
chapter list, as `beast` did above. Ids derived from a
heading are slugged the same way, so a title like "The Crypt, Pt. 2" can never
produce a second dot.

- Node ids are unique **within their file**.
- Inside a file, `-> chamber` refers to that file's `chamber`.
- Across files, `-> crypt.chamber`. Exactly one dot: namespace, then id.
- If a bare reference does not resolve locally, it is an error, never a silent
  search of other files. Ambiguity is not resolved by proximity.

In a multi-file project the qualified form is used everywhere an id appears
outside its own file: diverts, choice links (`[Go down](#crypt.chamber)`),
`visits()`, `goto:` and `start:` in `book.yaml`, the
`node`, `visits` and `seen` fields of a save, and the ids of choices and
alternatives (17.1) that `taken`, `alts` and `picks` are keyed by. A
single-file book keeps all of these bare, per 4.1.

Namespaces do not nest. A path has at most one dot. If a book ever outgrows
that, the answer is a longer `as:` alias, not a second level.

### 4.4 Languages

A book may exist in several languages at once. The structure is shared and
only the text differs, so a reader can switch language mid-game without losing
their place. You declare the languages in `book.yaml`:

```yaml
languages:
  default: de
  available: [de, en]
chapters:
  - start.md
  - crypt.md
```

As soon as a book declares a second language, every language, the default
included, gets a directory named after it, holding the same chapter file
names: `de/start.md`, `en/start.md`. A book that declares
a single language keeps its chapters where they are, because naming the
language a book is written in should not cost a directory level. A book without
a `languages:` block has exactly one language, named `default`.

**The default language owns the logic. Translations carry text only.** A
translated file is a catalogue: headings that name the node, paragraphs in the
order the node prints them, and list items in the order the node offers them.
It has no diverts, no conditions, no assignments, no directives, and its list
items carry no links. A translated node looks like this:

```markdown
# The Iron Gate {#gate}

The gate closes the crypt off to the north.

The key turns as though it had been waiting for you.

Without the key the gate stays what it is.

* Take the key
* Back to the light
```

A translation sets its own glue (5.5) or leaves it out. Glue is part of the
text, and no language has to break its sentences where another one did.

Paragraphs replace paragraphs and list items replace button labels, each in
source order, counted as two separate streams so that nesting never has to be
mirrored. Conditional arms, gather text and combat exit text are paragraphs
like any other. Inside a paragraph, a conditional alternative keeps its arms
and writes `?` for its condition (`{?: reich|arm}` where the default language
wrote `{gold >= 10: rich|poor}`), because a condition is logic, and logic
stays with the default language. A translation with a different count
is E071, and a node the default language does not have, or does not
translate, is E070.

Because there is one structure, the ids of 17.1 line up, and those ids are what
`taken` and `alts` in the save are keyed by. Translated headings therefore
need an explicit `{#id}`: a derived id would follow the translated title and
drift apart from the original.

**A translation may override a whole node** where a language needs different
logic, not just different words: a plural that only one language branches on, a
form of address that depends on a stat. Write the node with logic, exactly as
in the default language, and it replaces that node entirely for that language.
E071 does not apply to an overridden node, and the linter says so (L019),
because its choice and alternative ids are then its own. What that means for a
language switch is stated in 20.1.

The runtime carries the language in the save as `lang` and can switch it at
any point, including mid-combat: outside overridden nodes nothing but the text
changes.

### 4.5 Scope of everything else

Only node ids are namespaced. Variables, inventory, memory words and
visit counts are global to the book. This keeps the save flat (section 15).

## 5. The narrative text

Indentation is two spaces, everywhere. Tabs are an error, not a style
preference, because indentation carries meaning here.

### 5.1 Nodes

A node is a numbered section of your gamebook: the place a reader lands, reads,
and chooses from. You write one as a Markdown heading:

```markdown
# The Crypt {#crypt}
## The Second Chamber {#chamber}
```

`#` is a node, `##` a subnode. The heading text is the title for humans. The
id in `{# }` is the name used by diverts. Headings and subheadings are
structure for readers only, and both produce plain nodes for the compiler, so
you can organize your file however reads best.

You may leave the id out, and one is derived from the title. That is fine for
throwaway nodes and unwanted in a published book, because renaming the title
then breaks every divert. The linter warns (L005).

`###` and deeper are not nodes but headings inside prose. Use them freely
to structure a long passage.

### 5.2 Diverts

A divert is a jump to another node, the "turn to 137" of a printed gamebook.
When it happens without a choice, it sits alone on a line:

```markdown
-> chamber
-> crypt.chamber
-> END
```

The first form jumps within the file, the second across files, as you saw in
4.3. `-> END` ends the story. A node that ends with neither a divert nor a
choice is an error, not a silent stop (E110). A fight, which you will meet in
section 8, also counts as a way on. Every path through your book has to lead
somewhere, even if that somewhere is the end.

E110 is a rule about what is written. It has a twin at runtime: a node whose
choices have all been taken has no way on either, however carefully it was
written. The runtime raises an error there
rather than showing a page with nothing on it, and L029 finds most of those
nodes before a reader ever does (19).

### 5.3 Choices

Choices are the moments your reader decides. You write them as Markdown list
items:

```markdown
* [Open the door](#hall) You press the latch down.
+ [Look around](#room)
* {skill > 8} [Bend the bars apart](#gate)
* [Run](#flight)
```

- `*` is once-only, `+` is sticky. A once-only choice disappears after the
  reader takes it, a sticky one stays available. Both are Markdown bullets, so
  a renderer shows a list.
- **The marker requires a following space.** `*The wind howls.*` and
  `**No!**` are emphasis, not choices. This is Markdown's own rule, and it is
  why nesting uses indentation rather than ink's `**` and `***`.
- The link text is the button. Everything after the link is text printed after
  the choice is taken. The button text is not repeated, and an author who wants it
  repeated writes it twice.
- `{ condition }` before the link makes the choice conditional. It goes before
  the link so that a reader skimming the file sees first whether an option
  appears at all. A condition asks what is true, it does not roll: an option
  that appears or vanishes by dice flickers whenever the page is drawn again.
  Put the roll inside the choice, where the reader can see what it decided,
  which is what L020 checks.
- Nesting is by indentation, at most three levels:

```markdown
* [Ask the innkeeper]() He wipes out a mug.
  * [Ask about the road]() "North, but not at night."
  * [Ask about the tower]() He says nothing.
  ---
  You put a coin on the counter.
* [Leave](#road)
```

`[Text]()` with an empty target means stay here, then show the next level.
This is ink's weave with Markdown indentation: a conversation that branches
and rejoins without leaving the page. The empty link renders as a link that
goes nowhere, rather than one that jumps to the top of the page.

### 5.4 Gathers

A gather is where separate threads meet again: the reader asked about the road
or the tower, and either way the scene continues with the coin on the counter.
You write it as a line of `---` at the indentation of the choices it gathers.
Rendered it is a horizontal rule, read aloud "the threads join again here". An
id is optional: `--- {#after-inn}`.

A gather closes the level it gathers. Once the text after it has run, that
level is done: what stands next is the level above, offered again without
whatever the reader has already taken from it, and at the outermost level the
node ends. Without this rule a nested set of choices would keep offering
itself and the reader could never get back out to the scene that holds it.

A gather must follow a choice or a choice's indented block, never a paragraph:
`---` under a paragraph turns that paragraph into a heading in every Markdown
renderer. The compiler rejects it (E120).

The frontmatter is fenced by `---` too (4.1), and the two never collide. The
frontmatter is only the frontmatter when it opens the very first line of the
file, and it closes at its second `---`. Every `---` after that is a gather,
and a gather is only a gather where a choice stands above it. A file that
begins with a story rather than a frontmatter has no fence to close and no
ambiguity to resolve.

### 5.5 Paragraphs

A paragraph runs to the next blank line, exactly as in Markdown. The line
breaks an author uses to keep the source readable are not breaks in the text,
so you can wrap a paragraph at any width and it still arrives as one
paragraph. A translation counts paragraphs the same way (4.4).

**Glue.** Sometimes a sentence has to survive a choice: it begins before the
reader decides and ends after, whichever way they went. `<>` at the end of a
line, or at the start of the next one, says that the two join instead of
standing as two paragraphs:

```markdown
* [Deny]() "Nothing," I say<>
* [Boast]() "A cryptographer," I say<>
---
<>, and the room goes quiet.
```

Either mark is enough, and both may appear. The halves are printed in the same
turn even though a choice stands between them in the source, so what the
reader sees is one paragraph, and a screen reader hears one. That holds every
time the page is drawn, not only the first: a save that comes back, an undo,
a boundary that brings time in and a language switch all rebuild the page,
and they rebuild it glued.

Glue is text, not logic, which is what lets 4.4 keep working: a translation
sets its own glue where its own grammar wants it, or sets none and keeps the
two paragraphs. The number of paragraphs in the source does not change either
way, so the catalogue still lines up. That freedom is also the warning. A
sentence assembled from pieces in different branches is the hardest thing in a
book to translate, and an author writing for more than one language is usually
better off writing it whole in each branch.

### 5.6 Varying text

A line can change from one visit to the next, or depend on what the reader
carries. Those variations go inline, inside curly braces:

```markdown
{For the first time|Once again|Yet again} you stand before it.
{&A crack|A crunch|Silence} in the undergrowth.
{!A raven calls.|}
{~Left|Right|Straight on}
{has("lantern"): The light reaches far.|It is pitch dark.}
You have {gold} gold pieces left.
```

A sequence has no mark. It steps through its options and then stays on the
last. A cycle `&` wraps around instead. A once-only `!` shows each option once
and then falls silent. A random `~` picks one of them, drawn from the same
stream as the dice, so a seed reproduces it. A conditional `:` chooses by what
is true, and a bare expression like `{gold}` prints its value. Alternatives inside
alternatives do not exist, so each brace stays simple enough to read at a
glance.

**A paragraph that renders to nothing is not a paragraph.** Write four
conditional lines under one another and, on a page where none of them is
true, there is nothing to print, but the newlines that joined them would
leave spaces behind. Nothing goes to the host: no empty paragraph, no
paragraph that is only a space, and inside one that does have something to
say, a run of spaces counts as one and none of them sits at an edge. A host
does not have to sieve, and one that does hides the day the rule breaks.

**A colon does not always mean a condition.** Prose is full of colons ("In the log
book: the last entry breaks off"), and a sequence must be able to carry one. The text before the first colon outside quotes is a condition when
one of these holds:

- it is `?`, the placeholder a translation writes (4.4);
- it carries an operator: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `and`, `or`,
  `not`, or a closing parenthesis. A head that says `gold >== 3` is a
  condition with a typo in it, and stays E130 rather than turning into
  prose;
- it is made of names alone, and every one of them is declared. `{lamp: lit|
  dark}` tests the fact `lamp`, while `{Careful: a step|Mind yourself}` is a
  sequence, because nothing called `Careful` was ever declared.

Anything else is text. The last rule is the only one the parser cannot settle
alone, because what is declared is known one pass later, and nothing about the
book depends on when it is decided. A head that lands differently in two
languages is E071, the same mismatch as any other change of shape in a
translation.

### 5.7 Branching

When more than a phrase depends on a condition, you branch whole blocks of
text. Branching is multi-line, by indentation, never with `-` at the start of
a line, so that nothing collides with choices:

```markdown
{ gold >= 10 }
  The innkeeper nods and points up the stairs.
  -> room
{ gold >= 3 }
  He points at the stable.
  -> straw
{ else }
  He points at the door.
  -> alley
```

The conditions are tried from top to bottom, and the first true one wins, with
`{ else }` catching whatever falls through.

**A blank line ends the chain.** The header below it starts a new one, tried
whatever the one above decided, so two blocks that have nothing to do with
each other are written the way paragraphs are, with a blank line between
them. `{ else }` is the one exception: it has nothing to start and belongs to
the chain above it, blank line or not.

A branch header and the varying text of 5.6 both start with `{`, and the
compiler has to tell them apart. **Disambiguation rule.** A line beginning with
`{` is inline text if any of these hold:

- the first character inside is `&`, `!` or `~`
- the contents contain `|` or `:`
- no indented line follows

Otherwise it is a block header. This keeps `{!A raven calls.}` and a bare
`{gold}` on their own line meaning what they look like.

### 5.8 Assignments

An assignment changes the state of the world: coins spent, wounds taken, a key
pocketed. It starts with `~`:

```markdown
~ gold = gold - 3
~ stamina -= 2
~ take("silver key")
```

Operators: `+ - * / %`, `== != > < >= <=`, `and or not`. Word forms only.
Numbers are integers. No floating point, no string comparison.

`~` is always at the start of a line, never mid-line. Execution follows source
order, so

```markdown
~ gold -= 3
You have {gold} coins left.
```

prints the reduced amount. Inside a choice, assignments go on their own
indented lines below it.

### 5.9 Marking a kind of text, and images

```markdown
The letter is written in a shaky hand. {.letter}
```

`{.name}` at the end of a paragraph says what kind of text this is, not what
it should look like. The view layer decides whether a letter is indented,
boxed or italic. There is no other formatting control.

An image is Markdown's own spelling, on a line of its own:

```markdown
![An archway of roughly hewn stone, and beyond it nothing but darkness.](gruft.png)
```

It takes a `{.name}` like a paragraph does, and it is a line, never part of a
sentence. A picture sits between paragraphs, so one written mid-sentence is
E181. Without that error it would reach the reader quietly, printed as the
literal characters `![alt](file)` in the middle of a sentence, which is the
kind of mistake nobody sees while writing and everybody sees on the page.

The alt text is required, and E182 when it is missing. That one rule decides
a lot: this language has no decorative image, because a picture worth putting
on the page is worth a sentence, and a reader who cannot see it is owed that
sentence. The alt text is the accessible name, never also a caption.

The file is a path relative to the book's own directory, never a URL and
never a path that climbs out of that directory (E183). Principle 6 is the
reason: what ships is the output and the files beside it, and a path that
leaves is a picture no reader ever sees. The file also has to exist, which is
E184 and the one check in the whole compiler that reads the disk rather than
the sources it was handed.

Both halves are translated. In a catalogue (4.4) an image line replaces an
image line, in source order, a third stream beside paragraphs and labels. A
count that does not line up is E071, as in the other two streams. The
alt text is translated because it is text, the file because a
map with names written on it has to be redrawn, not relabelled. A translation
that names the same file is the ordinary case and costs nothing to write.

A second resolution rides along by name: `gruft@2x.png` beside `gruft.png` is
the same picture at twice the size. The language says nothing more about it.
The linter checks that a file exists, never that a size matches, so `@2x` and
`@3x` are optional wherever they appear, and a book that ships only base
files is complete. The web export copies whatever is there and uses the base
file, and a native host picks the one that fits its screen (`HOSTS.md` 9). The spelling
is Apple's, borrowed for want of a neutral one, and a platform that writes it
differently maps the suffix in its host, rather than the language growing a
second spelling.

### 5.10 Functions

When the same few assignments appear in many places, you give them a name. A
function is a node declared with `fn`:

```markdown
# fn heal(amount)
~ stamina = min(stamina + amount, stamina_max)
~ return stamina
```

The declared name is the id, and a function node carries no `{# }` (E011). You
call it as `{heal(4)}` in text or `~ heal(4)` as a statement, and it is
resolved in the local namespace first and qualified as `crypt.heal(4)` across
files. No reference parameters, no divert targets as parameters. A function is
called, never visited, so a divert to a function node is an error (E042).

## 6. Built-in functions

Expressions in your story can call a small set of functions that the runtime
brings along. They cover dice, checks, the inventory, code words and a little
bookkeeping about where the reader has been.

| Function | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `roll(n, sides)` | Sum of n dice with `sides` faces |
| `random(min, max)` | Integer in range, both bounds inclusive |
| `test_luck()` | A check against `luck`, then `luck` drops by one, never below zero |
| `test("stat")` | A check against the stat, with nothing spent |
| `has("item")` / `take("item")` / `drop("item")` | Inventory |
| `take("item", n)` | Grants n uses of a consumable |
| `uses("item")` | Uses left, 0 when the item is absent |
| `use("item")` | Applies the item's effect, spends one use, returns true or false |
| `equip("item")` / `equipped("item")` | Equip a weapon or armour, and test whether that item is the equipped one |
| `remember("word")` / `knows("word")` / `forget("word")` | Code words, Lone Wolf style |
| `visits(node)` | How often the node has been entered |
| `turns()` | Turns taken so far |
| `choice_count()` | Number of choices currently visible |
| `place("id")` | The index of a declared place, resolved at compile time (13.2) |
| `min(a,b)` / `max(a,b)` / `abs(a)` | Arithmetic |

Two of these functions, `test()` and `test_luck()`, perform what the table
calls **a check**. A check is the classic "Test your Luck" moment from the
old gamebooks: you roll dice and compare the result to a stat. A check rolls
`checks.dice` and compares it to the value. With
`succeeds: at-most`, the roll has to come in at or under the value, which is
the Fighting Fantasy rule and the default. With `at-least` it has to reach it.
Both `test()` and `test_luck()` go through the same rule, so they cannot drift
apart, and both consume the dice stream of section 15.

You tune the rule in the frontmatter, under `checks:`, and these are the
defaults written out:

```yaml
checks:
  dice: "roll(2,6)"      # the default
  succeeds: at-most      # at-most or at-least
```

The defaults give you a feel for the odds: a stat of 10 succeeds about 92% of
the time, a stat of 7 about 58%, and a stat of 5 barely 28%. A book with a
d10 table instead writes `dice: "roll(1,10)"`.

`take()` fails silently when the inventory is full, and `has("...")` after it
is the way to check. Item and code word names are plain strings, compared case-insensitively
after trimming, and they appear only as arguments, never as values, which is why
the ban on string comparison in 5.8 costs nothing.

The quotation marks above are part of the language, not typography. Every
argument that names something (a stat, an item, a code word, the id in
`place()`) is written in quotes, and there is no way to compute one: stats
hold numbers, and 5.8 bans comparing strings. A bare name there reads the
value instead of the name, so `test(skill)` arrives at 9 and then asks for a
stat called `9`. That check fails every time it is made, and nothing about the
page says why, which is why E133 rejects it rather than the runtime shrugging
at it. A number is no better than a bare name: `has(0)` looks for an item
called `0`, so E133 asks for a string and not merely for a literal. E133 also
catches the name that is quoted but names nothing: `test("gskill")` is a typo
an author never sees, because a failed check looks exactly like bad luck.

The rule holds wherever an expression stands, the frontmatter included: a
stat's `start:`, an item's `effect:` and `when:`, the dice under `checks:`,
the arithmetic of `combat:` and `death:`, and the value of a fact or an event.

`has(x)` is exactly `uses(x) > 0`. A non-consumable counts as one use, and
taking one that is already held changes nothing. Beyond the functions, five
read-only variables come built in. Four are about fighting: `in_combat`,
`weapon_attack`, `weapon_damage` and `armour_defence`, and you will meet them
again in the combat chapter, section 8. The fifth, `due`, belongs to
scheduled events and means nothing anywhere else (12.2).

## 7. Frontmatter: the character sheet

The frontmatter is the YAML block at the top of your book. Think of it as the
character sheet and the rulebook rolled into one: it declares the stats, the
starting inventory, the items, the enemies and the house rules for combat and
checks. Everything the story later does arithmetic on starts its life here. The
example below is a complete frontmatter for a small Fighting Fantasy style
book.

```yaml

blurb: A hedge, a gap, a crypt - and one night to get all three wrong.

  luck:     { name: Luck,    start: "roll(1,6) + 6",  max: start }

                   effect: "skill = skill_max" }

  cave-troll: { name: Cave Troll, skill: 9, stamina: 11,
                strings: {
                  combat.hit:   "{&Your blade opens the troll's arm.|The troll takes the blow across the shoulder.}",
                  combat.taken: "{&A fist the size of a helmet finds you.|The club comes down and you are slower than it.}" } }

death:
  when: "stamina <= 0"
  goto: crypt.death

undo:
  depth: 10

checks:
  dice: "roll(2,6)"
  succeeds: at-most

strings:
  combat.hit:   "{&You wound|Your blade finds|You get through the guard of} {enemy}."
  combat.taken: "{enemy} {&wounds you|gets past your guard|catches you across the ribs}."
  combat.tie:   "{~The blades meet and nothing comes of it.|Steel on steel, and no more.}"
  combat.down:  "{enemy} {&goes down|does not get up again}."
```

Start with `stats:`. Every stat becomes a global variable, so once you declare
`stamina` here you can write `stamina -= 2` anywhere in the story. `max:
start` means "the opening roll is also the ceiling", the Fighting Fantasy
rule, and exposes `<key>_max` as a read-only variable. The key is the
identifier the story does arithmetic on, and `name:` is what a reader sees and
takes a language table like any other reader-visible field. A stat without a
`name:` is internal: it still drives the story, but no reader ever sees it,
and section 20 leaves it off the character sheet. Imported books arrive full
of those, because `import` cannot invent a name for a variable that ink only
ever tested, and a wall of `seen_tellme: 0` next to the prose is not a
character sheet. A host that wants every value regardless still gets it from the
runtime, marked as unnamed.

Nothing in the frontmatter describes
presentation. How a stat is drawn, what the inventory panel is called, what
the attack button says, which font the page uses: all of that belongs to the
view layer of section 20, which knows about screens. A book that carries its
own layout stops being portable to the next one. `strings:` is the exception
that proves it. It holds only lines the story tells, such as who wounded whom,
and not one button label.

`setup:` is character creation, the "choose your equipment before you set out"
page of the old books. The runtime shows each block in order before the first
node, each one a "pick `pick` from this list". A pick grants an item
(`item:`), a code word (`remember:`) or both. That covers the weapon and
potion choice of Fighting Fantasy, the five disciplines of Lone Wolf and the
spell list of Sorcery!. Without `setup:` the story starts immediately.

`death:` is your safety net, so you never have to write "if you have died,
turn to 400" by hand. `death.when` is evaluated after every assignment and
every combat round. When it becomes true the runtime diverts to `death.goto`.

`combat:` and `enemies:` are the house rules for a fight, and section 8 walks
through them one by one. The example above leaves out `combat.flee_cost`,
which is what running away takes off your stamina, because leaving it out is
how you get the Fighting Fantasy value of two.

`blurb:` is the back of the book: two or three sentences a reader sees
before the story begins, and the one piece of prose that lives in the
frontmatter rather than in a node, because it describes the book and not the
world. It is plain text, with no expression and no alternative, and it is
optional. A player that has it shows it before the setup and the first page
(`HOSTS.md` 3 and 5), and a host that lists books on a shelf reads it from
`meta` like a cover (`HOSTS.md` 9).

Books travel, so translation is built in. Any field a reader can see may be a
language table instead of a scalar, in `title:`, `blurb:`, item `name:`,
setup titles and labels, enemy `name:` and every entry of `strings:`:

```yaml
items:
  sword: { name: { de: Schwert, en: Sword }, kind: weapon }
```

A scalar means the same text in every language. A table missing a declared
language is E072.

`strings:` holds the lines the combat resolver narrates, which you cannot
write by hand because they happen round by round.
The runtime ships English defaults and a book overrides what it needs. The
list in the example above is complete. `{enemy}` is the only placeholder. A
book written in another language should override all of them, which is what
L017 checks.

A line here is prose, and prose is section 5.5: the alternatives of 5.6 work
in it exactly as they do in a paragraph. `&` cycles, `!` shows each wording
once, `~` picks at random from the dice stream, no mark steps through and
holds the last, and a condition chooses by what is true. That is how a fight
that lasts eight rounds stops saying the same sentence eight times. Braces do
not nest, here as everywhere: an alternative cannot hold another, nor a
placeholder. Put `{enemy}` outside the braces, as the example does. Each wording keeps its
place across the whole book, so a cycle carries on where the last fight left
it rather than restarting with every fight.

The counters behind that live in `alts` and `picks` like any other
alternative (15), under ids of their own: `@strings:combat.hit:a0` for a
book-wide line and `@enemy:goblin:combat.hit:a0` for one a single enemy
writes. Positions decide, so a translation may offer more wordings or fewer
than the language it translates. Unlike a node (E071), nothing here has to
line up.

`facts:`, `events:` and `places:` belong in the frontmatter too, and have
sections of their own: 10, 12 and 13.

### 7.1 Items

`items:` is optional. An item that is never declared is just its own name, a
key or a rope, which keeps short books free of bookkeeping. A declared item
gains a display name and a kind. There are four kinds, and each one tells the
runtime what the item can do:

- `weapon`: `attack_bonus:` and `damage_override:` surface as the read-only
  variables `weapon_attack` and `weapon_damage`, so the combat formula can
  name them. Exactly one weapon is equipped at a time.
- `armour`: `defence:` surfaces as `armour_defence`. Exactly one is equipped.
- `gear`: carried, tested with `has()`, nothing automatic.
- `consumable`: has `uses:` and an `effect:`, an assignment run when the item
  is used. `when:` restricts when it may be used, and `in_combat` is a built-in
  variable for exactly this. The last use removes the item.

Whatever plays the book shows the inventory as a list and offers Use and
Equip through the runtime's own calls (`HOSTS.md` 2), so eating provisions or
drinking a potion needs no choice written by you.
`slots:` counts entries, not uses, so ten provisions occupy one slot.

An item in `inventory.start` or in a `setup:` block that is neither declared
nor a bare string is an error (E060), and an unknown `kind:` is E061.

## 8. Combat

A fight is one directive with indented exits. An exit is a name followed by
either a plain divert (an arrow that sends the story to another node) or the
choice form of 5.3, so you write the button label and the follow-on text in
the spelling you already know:

```markdown
!combat goblin
  win  -> crypt.treasure
  lose -> crypt.death
  flee [Run for the stairs](#forest.clearing) You leave your shield behind.
```

The three exits behave differently, and the difference is who decides. `win`
and `lose` are outcomes, not decisions, so a link text there is printed
rather than shown as a button. `flee` is a decision, so its link text is the
button the player sees once fleeing becomes possible. Without a link text the
view layer names the button itself.

The fight itself runs on the formulas you declared under `combat:` in the
frontmatter. The runtime resolves it round by round: both sides roll
`combat.attack`, the higher total costs the loser `combat.damage` stamina,
never below zero, a tie costs nothing. When an enemy falls, the resolver
says so in the same breath: `combat.down` is the dying sentence, and it
follows the blow that felled it, whether that blow was the round's own or a
lucky one. Nothing is added behind your back:
equipment reaches the fight only through `weapon_attack`, `weapon_damage` and
`armour_defence`, and a formula that does not name them ignores equipment
entirely. Both formulas are evaluated for the enemy too, where the equipment
variables read zero, so `armour_defence` only ever protects the player.
With `luck_in_combat`, the player may test luck after each hit, with the usual
consequences (more damage dealt on a lucky hit, less taken on a lucky escape).
`flee` appears as an exit once `flee_after` rounds have passed. What getting
away costs is yours to decide. `combat.flee_cost` is an expression like the
other two, evaluated at the moment the player flees, and its result is taken off
stamina, never below zero:

```yaml
combat:
  attack: "skill + roll(2,6) + weapon_attack"
  damage: "max(weapon_damage, 2) - armour_defence"
  flee_cost: "2"
```

Leave `flee_cost` out and it is `2`, the Fighting Fantasy rule, so a book that
wants that rule writes nothing. Write `0` and running away is free. Write
`roll(1,6)` and it is a gamble. Write `max(4 - armour_defence, 0)` and heavy
armour buys you a cheaper retreat. The expression sees the same variables the
other combat formulas see, and a malformed one is E130 like any other.

When several enemies come at once, list them in sequence:
`!combat goblin, goblin, cave-troll`.

A goblin and a cave troll do not wound you the same way, and a fight reads
better when they do not say so in the same sentence. An enemy may therefore
carry a `strings:` block of its own, with the same four keys and the same
prose as the book-wide one:

```yaml
enemies:
  cave-troll:
    name: Cave Troll
    skill: 9
    stamina: 11
    strings:
      combat.taken: "{&A fist the size of a helmet finds you.|The club comes down and you are slower than it.}"
```

Three levels, and the nearest one wins: what the enemy writes, else what the
book writes under `strings:`, else the English default of section 7. It is
per key, not per block, so the troll above still takes the book's wording for
a hit and a tie. A fifth key is E062 there as it is in the book. Because the enemy is named by the block it stands in,
`{enemy}` is rarely what you want inside it: write "the troll" outright.

An enemy is declared once and fought wherever the book likes, so its wordings
travel with it. A single fight that wants a wording of its own has the
ordinary prose around the directive for that. The directive itself carries
exits, not narration.

Consumables whose `when:` allows it can be used between rounds from the
inventory panel, which is how a potion mid-fight works without you writing
anything.

The rules for the exits: `win` is required. `lose` is optional and defaults
to `death.goto`. `flee` is an error unless the enemy declares `flee_after`
(E150).

This directive fixes one rule system, and that is deliberate. If you want a
different one, you write combat by hand with `roll()`, variables and a sticky
choice, and never use the directive.

## 9. What is a fact, and what is a variable

Everything so far has been about variables: stats, gold, items, code words.
A variable is state the story owns and the reader changes by playing.
Sections 10 to 13 add a second kind of value, the fact. A
fact is something the book asks about rather than owns: a value computed
from state the world supplies, the way a gamebook might tell you to check
whether it is night before entering the graveyard.

Principles 7 to 9 carry those four sections: the book holds no
time, a fact is a pure function of its state, and facts are read-only to the
book. A book that keeps all three can be replayed from a seed and a save. Break any one of them and a
replay stops matching the game it replays: a book that reads a clock on its
own gives a different answer tomorrow, a fact that rolls dice gives a
different answer on the same day, and a fact the book could write to is not
a fact at all, just a variable wearing a costume.

When you design a book, you will meet values that could plausibly be either.
The test: does the reader change the world, or only which slice of it we are
looking at? The sun's height over a place is true whether
or not anyone stands there, and the reader who travels changes where we look,
not where the sun is, so it is a fact. Air in a suit is not: it drains
because the reader wears the suit and breathes, so the reader is changing
the world, and it belongs in a variable.

The same test settles the practical cases. Gold is a variable, because
spending it changes the world. Whether the shop is open at this hour is a
fact, because the reader arriving does not move the shop's hours. If you are
still unsure, ask who would notice if the reader had never been there: a
value that would be the same anyway is a fact, and a value that only exists
because the reader acted is a variable.

## 10. Facts

Section 9 drew the line: a variable is what the book writes, a fact is what it only reads. Think of the weather outside your window: you do not decide it, you glance at it. Some facts never change, some are computed from other values, and some arrive from the world outside the book.

### 10.1 Declaration

You declare facts once for the whole book. `facts:` is a book-wide declaration and belongs in `book.yaml` or the single file's frontmatter, per 4.2. Every fact carries a `source:`, the way every declared item carries a `kind:`. The `source:` tells the runtime where the value comes from.

```yaml
stats:
  time:     { name: Time, start: 0 }      # the clock is the book's own

facts:
  day_length: { source: fixed, value: 24 }
  elapsed:    { source: host,  range: [0, 604800], fallback: 0,
                name: { de: Verstrichen, en: Elapsed } }
  is_night:   { source: derived,
                value: 'time % day_length >= 20 or time % day_length < 6' }
```

`time` sits under `stats:` because it is a stat, not a fact, and that is principle 7: the clock is something the book declares and advances, and the runtime never learns what its unit means. Your book owns its own clock, and facts are for the things it does not own.

Two fields work the same for every fact, whatever its source:

| Field      | Meaning                                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source:`  | `fixed`, `host` or `derived`. Required.                        |
| `name:`    | Reader-visible name, a language table like any other. Optional. |

Each source then asks for its own fields:

| Source    | Required            | Notes                                     |
| --------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `fixed`   | `value:`            | An integer literal, not an expression; a `range:` may bound it. |
| `host`    | `range:`, `fallback:` | Supplied from outside at a boundary. `holds:` optional. |
| `derived` | `value:`            | An expression, parsed at compile time.    |

A host fact answers one more question: is it a duration, or a state?

```yaml
facts:
  elapsed: { source: host, range: [0, 604800], fallback: 0 }
  weather: { source: host, range: [0, 3], fallback: 0, holds: true }
```

`elapsed` is seconds since the last boundary. Handing the same seconds over
twice would spend them twice, so a host value is **consumed** by the
boundary that takes it and falls back afterwards (11.2). `weather` is
different. It is not an amount of anything but what the world is like
right now, and it stays that way until the world changes. `holds: true` says
exactly that: the value survives until the host sends another one, and a
book that has never been given one reads its `fallback:`.

Which of the two a fact is follows from the test of section 9, asked once
more: is this an amount that is used up, or a state that simply is? `holds:`
on anything but a `host` fact is E172, because nothing supplies a `fixed` or
`derived` fact in the first place.

A fact name shares the namespace of variables and stats: a collision is E170. Facts are global to the book, like variables (4.5). An unknown `source:` is E160, a missing required field E161, and a `fixed` value or a `fallback` outside its own `range:` is E162.

Values are integers, per 5.8. A fact that wants a fraction states its unit smaller: minutes rather than hours, thousandths of a degree rather than degrees. A condition stores as `1` or `0`, which is what the save in 16.1 shows.

### 10.2 Reading a fact

Once a fact is declared, you already know how to use it. A fact is read wherever a variable is read: in text, in a choice condition, in a branch, in an event. There is no new spelling.

```
{is_night: The gallery lies in the dark.|Daylight falls through the hatch.}

* {is_night} [Turn in for the night](#camp.sleep)
```

Reading is all a fact does. Assigning to a fact is E164, and E164 comes before E131: a fact name is in scope, so without that order the error would never be the right one. A book that wants to change something declares a variable.

### 10.3 Derived facts

A derived fact is a value your book computes from values it already has. Think of it as a small formula with a name: you write the expression once and read the result everywhere.

A derived fact may read variables, stats, counters and facts declared **before** it. That gives a total order without a dependency solver, the same answer 5.7 gives to ambiguity: declaration order decides. A reference to a later fact, or a cycle, is E163.

A derived fact is a pure function of its state, per principle 8: from the same state you always get the same value. Dice and anything that changes state are E169, so `{ source: derived, value: 'roll(1,6)' }` does not compile. Without that check principle 8 would be a promise nothing keeps.

This purity is not a limitation but where your book keeps interpretive control. The layer below hands out numbers. Twilight is a definition, and the book writes its own:

```yaml
  sun_elevation: { source: host, range: [-90, 90], fallback: 45, holds: true }
  dusk:          { source: derived, value: 'sun_elevation < 0 and sun_elevation > -6' }
  long_gone:     { source: derived, value: 'elapsed > 259200' }
```

`sun_elevation` is a host fact, the next section's subject: an app that knows
where and when the reader is hands the number over, and the book decides what
counts as dusk. Both derived facts read a fact declared above them, in that order.

### 10.4 Host facts

A **host** is whatever runs your book: a reading app, a website, an export playing in a browser. A host fact is the one thing the language cannot compute for itself. The host supplies it at a boundary (11.1), the moment the story moves from one page to the next. The runtime clamps the supplied value into `range:` and never reads anything on its own, which is what keeps principle 8 true.

Without a host, or when a host supplies nothing, `fallback:` applies. A book therefore always plays: the single-file export of section 20 stays a complete game, and no book may require a network, per principle 6.

Exactly one host fact is defined by convention, because a book that wants elapsed real time should not invent its own name:

| Name      | Unit    | Meaning                                          |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `elapsed` | seconds | Time passed since the previous boundary          |

`elapsed` is never negative and is `0` at the first boundary. A clock that has moved backwards, a changed time zone and a resynchronised device all arrive as `0` rather than as a negative number, because a story clock that runs backwards produces states no book can be written against.

The value is not capped by the runtime. A reader who returns after a month gets the month. Capping is a book's decision and is written as a derived fact, where it is visible:

```yaml
  tick: { source: derived, value: 'min(elapsed, 3600)' }
```

Keeping the raw value alongside is what lets a book say "you were away for three days" while advancing its world by an hour.

## 11. Boundaries

A **boundary** is the moment your story steps from one page to the next, like the instant between turning a page of a paper gamebook and reading the new one. Everything time-related in this language happens in that instant, and nothing happens between two of them.

### 11.1 What a boundary is

A boundary is the moment a node is entered and the moment a choice has been taken. Nothing else. Host values arrive there, facts are computed there, events run there.

The strictness gives your reader a stable page. Between two boundaries the fact snapshot does not change. A page that offers an option cannot lose it while it is being read, which is the same promise L020 makes about dice.

**One boundary per completed transition.** A choice that runs a body and then diverts is one boundary, not two, and a chain of diverts arriving at the page the reader ends up on is still one. Concretely: `begin`, `choose` and `advance` are three of the calls a program makes to move a book along (`HOSTS.md` 2), and each of them, like leaving a fight through one of its exits, publishes exactly one snapshot. Without that rule an event with a `when:` and no counter would fire once or twice per click depending on whether the author happened to write a divert, which is a difference a reader can see.

Two moments deliberately have none. A **combat round** is not a boundary: the fight is one page, and an event firing between two swings would be a page contradicting itself mid-round. The **death page an event sent the reader to** is not one either, because the event that killed them would otherwise run again on the page it chose.

Inside a choice, the boundary falls after the choice's own effects and before the page that follows them is built. `~ time += 5` in a choice is the departure, and the arrival reads the clock it left behind. Follow-on text written on the choice itself belongs to the departure and renders before the boundary, which is the one place where text sees the older snapshot, and the reason 13.2 spells travel as an assignment on the choice rather than as something on the node it arrives at.

### 11.2 Order within a boundary

Inside that one instant, four things happen, always in the same order:

1. Host values are taken in and clamped.
2. Facts are computed in declaration order.
3. Events run in declaration order (12).
4. Facts are computed once more.

The fourth step exists for the events. The second pass is what events see reflected. It is a single pass, not a fixed point: two events at one boundary cannot chain through a derived fact, because nothing is recomputed between them. They can chain through a variable, because assignments take effect in order (5.8).

**Variables chain, facts do not.** An author will meet this rule once, so it belongs in the error message, not only here.

Host values also come with an expiry date. A host value is **consumed** by the boundary that takes it in: afterwards the fact falls back to its `fallback:` until the next `advance`. `elapsed` is a duration since the previous boundary, so a `choose` that followed an `advance` without this rule would spend the same seconds a second time.

Unless the fact is declared `holds:` (10.1). Then the value survives boundaries and stays until the host sends another one, which is what a state rather than a duration needs: the weather on the ridge does not stop being the weather because the reader took a choice. A value arriving now always wins over one being held.

### 11.3 The published snapshot

The snapshot the view and every condition see is the one from step 4. A page that contradicted the events that had just run would be a bug the author could not fix.

### 11.4 Place changes

A change to the place index takes effect at the next boundary, not inside the node that made it. One page shows one sky.

## 12. Events

Sometimes the world should act on its own. A wound that worsens as time passes, relief that arrives after three hundred turns: you could write that condition into every node the reader might visit, or you could write it once. An **event** is that single place. It watches a condition at every boundary and, when the condition holds, changes state.

### 12.1 Declaration

`events:` is book-wide, like `facts:`. An event has a condition and an assignment. It has no text and no divert.

```yaml
events:
  relief_arrives:
    once: true
    when: 'turns() >= 300'
    do:   'remember("RELIEF")'

  wound_worsens:
    counter: 'turns()'
    every:   10
    max_catchup: 1
    when: 'has("wound")'
    do:   'stamina -= 1'
```

The first event fires a single time, the moment its condition first holds. The second is recurring: it is scheduled against a counter and fires every ten steps. These are the fields you can combine:

| Field          | Meaning                                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `once:`        | Fires at most once in a playthrough.                        |
| `counter:`     | An integer expression the event is scheduled against.       |
| `every:`       | Fires each time the counter has advanced by this much.      |
| `max_catchup:` | Most firings at one boundary. Default 1.                    |
| `when:`        | Condition. Optional; absent means always.                   |
| `do:`          | One assignment or call, the same production as a `~` line.  |

Two of these do not mix, and one is not optional: `once:` and `every:` together are E168. An event without `do:` is E167.

The point of an event is one declaration instead of the same condition in forty nodes. What it cannot do is speak or move the reader: it sets state, a node reads it and narrates. That keeps the translation rule of 4.4 intact, because all text stays in nodes. An event nudges the world, and your nodes tell the reader about it.

### 12.2 Catching up

Picture a reader who puts the book down for a month and comes back. Their counter has jumped forward by a lot at a single boundary, and a recurring event would otherwise fire once per step. `max_catchup:` bounds that, and the anchor advances by the number of steps the counter actually took, so a bounded catch-up is not replayed at the next boundary: the missed firings are dropped, not queued. An event with `max_catchup: 1` whose counter jumped by fifty fires once and starts counting again from where the counter now stands.

Without a bound a book that was closed for a month wakes up dead. With one the author decides whether time away is dangerous or merely long.

There is a second way to spend that time, and it needs no second field. `max_catchup:` bounds how often `do:` runs, and **`due`** says how often it was owed. Inside an event's `do:` it is the number of firings the counter asked for at this boundary, before the bound stepped in. Everywhere else it is E173, because no such number exists there and reading it as 1 would be quietly wrong.

```yaml
events:
  air_leaks:
    counter: 'time'
    every:   10
    max_catchup: 1
    do: 'oxygen -= due'
```

That event fires once however long the book was closed, and takes what the whole absence cost: a month away is one loss of a month's air, not thirty losses of a day's, and not one loss of a day's with the rest quietly dropped. Which of the three a book wants is the author's call, and all three are now sayable: repeat up to the bound, drop what falls past it, or fold the whole backlog into one firing.

The condition plays fair here too. A `when:` that is false forfeits that boundary's firings but not the anchor's advance: time passed whether or not the wound was there to worsen, so the event does not owe the reader fifty rounds of damage the moment they are finally wounded.

### 12.3 Death

`death.when` is evaluated after every assignment (7), and an event assigns. An event can therefore kill without the reader having done anything. That is intended, and a book that does not want it writes its condition so that it cannot.

## 13. Places

A place is somewhere your book can be: the base camp, the ridge, the crypt.
You declare them once, in a small table, and the story travels between them.

### 13.1 The table

You declare places in the book-wide frontmatter. Each place has an id you use
in the text and a name per language for the reader.

```yaml
places:
  variable: location
  table:
    - { id: base,  name: { de: Basis, en: Base },   enter: base.airlock }
    - { id: ridge, name: { de: Grat,  en: Ridge },  enter: ridge.arrival }
```

`enter:` is optional. It names the node a journey to that place arrives at. If
the node named there does not exist, the compiler reports E166.

`variable:` is optional too. It names the stat that holds the current place
index. Its whole job is to turn the travel warning L026 from a guess into a
check: nothing else reads it, and the runtime never sees it. A book that
declares it must declare the stat as well, or it is E171. A fact will not do
here, because the book writes this one, and facts are values a book only reads.

### 13.2 Using a place

The place a book is at is an ordinary variable holding an index. You never
write that number yourself. Instead you write `place("ridge")`, which resolves
to the index at compile time, so the linter can check the name for you. An
unknown id is E165.

Travel in a choice looks like this:

```
* [Set out for the ridge](#ridge.arrival)
  ~ location = place("ridge")
  ~ time += 5
```

Three lines, three familiar spellings: an assignment sets the new place, a
second assignment advances the clock, and the divert in the choice target
moves the reader to the arrival node. Travel is deliberately not
a directive of its own. Three spellings already exist for these three things,
and principle 2 forbids inventing a fourth for their combination. That keeps
the part only your story knows, such as how long the journey takes for a reader
who is injured or who found a horse, an ordinary expression you can shape
freely.

The pairing is where a slip is easy: you move the reader but forget the clock,
or the other way around. That is what L026 watches for. With `places.variable:`
declared, a travel is any assignment to that variable, however the index was
arrived at. Without it, the linter looks for an assignment whose value came
from `place()`, which reads the common spelling and misses a book that computes
its index. That is why L026 is a warning in both cases: it is exact about what
it saw, never about what the author meant.

## 14. Full example

A complete little book, start to finish, with nothing new in it: every line
uses something you have already met. The frontmatter is section 7's character
sheet, the dice come from section 6, the choices and varying text from section
5, the combat from section 8.

```

Now the same book again, this time as a checklist of what you have learned.

The frontmatter declares everything and narrates nothing, as principle 3 asks.
Three stats are rolled with `roll()` at the start of the game, and `max: start`
pins each one to its opening value. `gold` starts at a plain number. The
inventory has eight slots and three starting items, and the key the crypt holds
is declared there too, because an item a book hands out is an item a book has
named. The provisions are a consumable with ten uses, an `effect:` that heals
without overshooting the maximum, and a `when:` that keeps them out of combat.
The combat block sets the attack formula and the damage for the whole book, the
goblin brings its own numbers and a `flee_after`, and the `death` block says
what state ends the game and where the story goes then. `undo` gives the reader
ten steps back.

Then the story. `# At the Forest Edge {#begin}` is a node, a heading with an id,
and `start: begin` in the frontmatter points at it. The `{&A crack|A
crunch|Silence}` is a cycling alternative from 5.6, so the forest sounds
different each time the reader comes back. All three choices there are `+`,
sticky: a path through a wood does not close because somebody walked it once.
The third is guarded by `{has("lantern")}` and only appears while the lantern is
in the inventory, with a line of text that prints after the choice is taken.

The brook shows a check and a gather. `[Jump the brook]()` has an empty target,
so the story stays in this node. The branch under it rolls `test("skill")` and
diverts on success, while the failure costs stamina and falls through. What it
falls through to is the `---` at the foot of the node, the gather, and the
divert after it sends the reader back to the brook to try again. Without that
gather the node would end in nothing, which is E110.

In the crypt, `{!Cold air meets you.|You know the way by now.}` is a once-only
alternative: the first visit gets the first text, every later visit the second.
The `!combat` block is section 8 in four lines: win and lose are diverts, and
the flee exit becomes available after three rounds because the goblin declared
`flee_after: 3`.

The second chamber is a subnode with a weave. Its opening line asks `has()`
rather than counting visits, so the sarcophagus is empty when the key is gone
and not when the reader has been here before. `[Take the key]()` runs the two
indented assignments: `take()` puts the key in the inventory and `remember()`
notes a code word. The gate then wants both, and if it has neither it offers
`test("luck")` instead, which is the same dice as the brook against a different
stat. Beyond it the story ends well and prints the gold, and the death node ends it
the other way. Both endings are `-> END`, which is the explicit ending every
path must reach one way or another.

That is the whole language a story needs.

The book above declares no facts, no events and no places, which is why none
of sections 10 to 13 shows up in it. That is the ordinary case. A book set in
one room at one hour of one day never asks the world outside it anything, and
it is a complete book. Everything from here on is written for people building
tools rather than books: how a game is saved, what the compiler emits, what
the linter checks, and how a book reaches a reader.

## 15. Runtime and save state

A save is a single JSON object. It captures everything a reader's playthrough
has accumulated, so that closing the book and opening it again feels like
never having left. A complete example, taken mid-adventure. It comes from the
multi-file Thornwood of section 4, not from the single-file book of section
14, which is why its node ids carry a namespace and why `silver key` is a bare
string here where section 14 declared a `silver-key` item (7.1 allows both):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "story": "thornwood@1.4.0",
  "seed": 1837465,
  "rolls": 42,
  "node": "crypt.chamber",
  "vars": { "gold": 9, "stamina": 14, "skill": 11, "luck": 7 },
  "inventory": { "sword": 1, "silver key": 1, "provisions": 7 },
  "equipped": { "weapon": "sword", "armour": null },
  "memory": ["KRAKEN"],
  "visits": { "crypt.crypt": 2, "forest.clearing": 1 },
  "lang": "de",
  "taken": { "crypt.chamber:c0": 1 },
  "alts": { "crypt.crypt:a0": 2 },
  "picks": { "crypt.crypt:a0": 1 },
  "visible": [0, 1],
  "screen": [{ "node": "crypt.chamber", "at": [0], "class": null }],
  "fight": null,
  "host":   { "elapsed": 700 },
  "facts":  { "day_length": 24, "elapsed": 700, "is_night": 1 },
  "events": { "fired": { "relief_arrives": true },
              "last":  { "wound_worsens": 120 } },
  "turn": 37,
  "seen": ["start.begin", "forest.clearing", "crypt.crypt"],
  "undo": []
}
```

`taken` counts how often each choice has been picked. That count is what makes `*` once-only: a choice the reader has already taken stops being offered. `alts` holds the position of each sequence and cycle, so an alternative picks up where it left off. Both are keyed by the ids the compiler hands out (17.1).

`visits` counts how often each node has been entered. `seen` lists the same nodes once each, in the order they were first entered, which a host can read to show a reader where they have been. `turn` counts the turns this playthrough has taken, and is what `turns()` returns.

`story` is the title and version of the book that wrote the save. Loading rejects a save whose `story` does not match the running book, and there is a good reason for that strictness: every other field is keyed against a specific book's nodes and choice ids, so a save from another version would resume as plausible-looking garbage. This also gives you a lever as an author: bumping `version:` in the frontmatter is the way to declare old saves invalid.

A refusal says why in fields, not only in a sentence: `reason` is `story` or `version`, and for `story` it names both the book the save came from and the book that turned it away. The fields are there because somebody has to act on them. A shop that ships a new edition meets this refusal on every reader who was mid-playthrough, and choosing between offering the previous edition and carrying the character across is something an app does in code, not something a reader should meet as an error message (`HOSTS.md` 7).

An **op** is one instruction in a compiled node: a run of text, a set of choices, a divert. Section 17.1 lists them all. `at`, on each entry of `screen`, is the position of that op inside its node, written as an index path. `[2, 0, 1]` reads as "op 2, its item 0, op 1 inside it". `at` is not a call stack. There are no return addresses and no frames of their own, which is exactly what principle 4 rules out.

A cluster of fields exists purely so the page can be repainted without replaying anything: `screen` names the text ops that are visible, `picks` records what each alternative on them settled on (nothing to do with `pick:` in `setup:`, which is a count of choices offered at character creation), `visible` says which choices were offered, and `fight` lists the enemies still standing. Storing all this beats re-deriving it because a condition may roll dice. Re-deciding any of it on a repaint would move the random stream and change the page under the reader. Reloading, undoing and switching language all repaint from these fields.

`host`, `facts` and `events` belong to section 16, which also explains why `facts` is in a save and not in a checkpoint.

`rolls` is the counter of the random stream: roll n follows deterministically from `seed` and n. Any playthrough can therefore be replayed exactly, and reloading a save produces the same roll as before rather than a fresh one.

### 15.1 Undo

A book may offer undo back to the last **root choice**, which is a choice at indentation level zero. Nested choices, gathers and combat rounds are not undo points. The effect is that undo never unwinds a single line of dialogue, only the decision that led into it.

You switch it on in the frontmatter:

```yaml
undo:
  depth: 10        # number of root choices that can be taken back, 0 disables
```

The runtime writes a checkpoint immediately before executing a level-zero choice. A checkpoint is the complete flat state of section 15, with two things left out. The undo stack itself is left out, so the stack cannot grow into itself. And `facts` are left out, because they are recomputed on restore: a checkpoint is always taken at a boundary, and principle 8 guarantees the recomputation gives the same answer (16.2).

Checkpoints ride along in the save under `"undo": [ ... ]`, which is why `depth` is capped rather than unlimited. The stack rides in the save and stays there when a save is handed on. A reader who carries a save to another device can take back the same choices they could have taken back where they left. A save is one thing in one format, and an export that quietly dropped a field would be a second one.

`rolls` is restored with everything else, so repeating the same choice reproduces the same dice. Undo cannot be used to re-roll a failed luck test, only to take a different path. That is also why undo past a death is allowed: it costs nothing that determinism has not already closed off.

Node references in a save are qualified exactly as the book writes them: the example above is a multi-file project, while a single-file book saves `"node": "chamber"`. And on loading, unknown fields are ignored, but a `version` higher than the runtime knows is refused with a clear message rather than partially applied.

## 16. State, save and undo

Facts and events need a place in the save file and an answer to the undo question. Both fit into section 15.

### 16.1 New fields

Three fields join the save:

```json
"host":   { "elapsed": 700 },
"facts":  { "day_length": 24, "elapsed": 700, "is_night": 1 },
"events": { "fired": { "relief_arrives": true },
            "last":  { "wound_worsens": 120 } }
```

`host` keeps the values the host supplied, `facts` keeps the computed snapshot, and `events` remembers which one-time events have fired and where each recurring event's anchor stands. A clock and a place index are ordinary variables and live in `vars`. Nothing else is added.

`host` is also where a `holds:` value lives between boundaries (10.1), and that is why it survives a save: a reader who puts the book down on a stormy ridge picks it up on the same ridge, and the host never has to remember to say so again.

`facts` is a cache. It is in the save rather than recomputed at load because a save may be written in the middle of a node, where variables have moved on since the last boundary. Recomputing at load would then show the reader different numbers than the page they left. It is not in a checkpoint, because a checkpoint is always taken at a boundary (15.1) and principle 8 guarantees the same result.

### 16.2 Undo

A checkpoint carries `host` and `events` and omits `facts`, which are recomputed on restore.

Undo therefore takes back a firing. The counter returns to what it was, the condition is false again, and going forward again reaches the same event. That is section 15.1's rule unchanged: undo opens a different path, it does not undo a consequence.

Story time is restored by undo, real time is not. A book that feeds its clock from `elapsed` lets a reader spend the same real seconds twice. In a single-player book this is harmless and deliberate, not a defect.

## 17. The two JSON formats

There are exactly two JSON formats in the whole system: the story JSON the compiler emits, and the save JSON from section 15.

### 17.1 Story JSON, the compiler output

The compiler turns your Markdown into a single JSON file. The design goal is that you can read and check it by hand, which is the deliberate contrast to ink's container bytecode. A small book after compilation:

```json
{
  "format": 1,
  "meta": { "title": { "de": "…" }, "version": "1.4.0", "start": "start.begin",
            "languages": ["de", "en"], "default": "de",
            "files": ["de/start.md", "de/crypt.md"] },
  "config": { "stats": {}, "inventory": {}, "items": {}, "setup": [], "combat": {},
              "enemies": {}, "death": {}, "undo": {}, "strings": {},
              "facts": {}, "events": {},
              "places": { "variable": null, "table": [] } },
  "nodes": {

        { "op": "text", "parts": ["A silver key lies on the sarcophagus."] },
        { "op": "choices", "items": [
          { "id": "crypt.chamber:c0", "label": ["Take the key"],
            "body": [
              { "op": "text", "parts": ["Something sighs in the dark."] },
              { "op": "call", "fn": "take", "args": [{ "lit": "silver key" }], "line": 44 }
            ] },
          { "id": "crypt.chamber:c1", "sticky": true, "label": ["Back to the light"],
            "target": "start.begin" }
        ] },
        { "op": "divert", "target": "start.begin" }
      ]
    }
   },
   "en": { "crypt.chamber": { "…": "same structure, translated text" } }
  }
}
```

A story file is shipped to every reader, so nothing redundant is emitted. Four rules keep it lean:

- file names live once in `meta.files`, and a node carries its index while the
  ops inside it carry a bare line number;
- `line` appears only where something can fail at runtime, which means on
  assignments, calls, combat, conditional choices and branch arms;
- defaults are left out. A choice is once-only, unconditional, targetless and
  without a body unless it says otherwise, and `target` is a plain string: a
  node id, or `"END"` for the end of the story. It is never absent-but-falsy,
  because an absent `target` already means something else, namely "run the
  body, then fall through to the gather";
- a run of plain text is a string rather than `{"t":"lit","v":"…"}`.

For the two-chapter example, these four rules together make the output 40% smaller than the verbose form, and easier to read by eye, which was the point of not shipping ink's bytecode.

Expressions are small prefix trees: `{ "op": ">=", "args": [{ "var": "gold" }, { "lit": 10 }] }`.

The ops you will meet are `text`, `image`, `choices`, `branch`, `divert`, `combat`, `assign`, `call`, `return` and `label` (a named gather). Text is a list of parts: `lit`, `print`, `alt` and `cond`. An image is `{ "op": "image", "src": "gruft.png", "alt": "…" }`, both required, with a `class` when the book wrote one. `-> END` compiles to `{ "op": "divert", "target": "END" }`, the same shape as any other divert.

There is no op for weave, and that is on purpose. A run of choices at one depth is one `choices` op, and whatever follows it in the same container is the gather. A choice with `"target": null` runs its own body and then falls through to exactly that.

Anything the runtime has to remember carries an id, which is what ties this format to the save format. Choices are named `node:c<n>`, alternatives `node:a<n>`, with `node` in the qualified form of 4.3 in a multi-file book. That is what `taken` and `alts` in the save are keyed by, and the reason for the namespace: two chapters that each have a `depart` would otherwise share one count, and a once-only choice taken in one would vanish from the other.

The combat lines of `strings:` are parts like any other text, one list per language, and their alternatives carry ids too. Those ids begin with `@`, which no node name can, so a book-wide line is `@strings:combat.hit:a0` and one an enemy writes is `@enemy:cave-troll:combat.taken:a0`. An enemy that writes none keeps no `strings` key at all, and a line that is a single run of text is a single string, by the fourth rule above.

### 17.2 Save JSON

Section 15 showed this one in full. It is versioned, and unknown fields are ignored.

## 18. Parser

As an author you will mostly meet the compiler through the error messages listed in 18.3.

The grammar is line-oriented: the kind of each line is decided by its first non-space characters. Only three cases are ambiguous, and all three are resolved in the sections above.

### 18.1 Pipeline

The compiler works in seven steps, each finishing before the next begins:

1. **Read** files listed in `book.yaml`, or the single file. Assign namespaces.
2. **Frontmatter** parsed as YAML, validated against the schema of section 7.
   Expression strings (`start:`, `when:`, `attack:`, `damage:`, `flee_cost:`,
   the dice under `checks:`, `death.when`, a derived fact's `value:`, an
   event's `when:` and `counter:`) go through
   the expression parser at this point, not at runtime. `effect:` and an
   event's `do:` are parsed as assignments, the same production as a `~` line
   without the `~`, and are the only YAML fields that are statements rather
   than expressions.
3. **Line scan** per file: classify every line, build the indentation tree.
   Tabs, odd indentation and indentation jumps of more than one level are
   errors here.
4. **Parse** each block into ops, expressions through a Pratt parser.
5. **Resolve** ids: collect all node ids per namespace, then resolve every
   divert, choice link, `visits()`, `goto:` and `start:`.
6. **Check** the rules of section 19.
7. **Emit** story JSON.

Because of step 2, everything that can be malformed in your frontmatter fails at compile time, long before a reader ever sees the book.

Being well formed is not the whole of it. Those expressions run through the same checks as the ones in the story, against the same scope: the declared stats, their `_max`, the facts and the built-in variables of section 6. An item that heals a stat nobody declared is E131 there exactly as it is in a node, a call to a function nobody wrote is E131, `due` outside an event's `do:` is E173, and a name argument that is not a name is E133.

### 18.2 Line kinds

The first characters of a line decide what the parser makes of it, and nothing else is consulted.

| Starts with | Kind | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `# ` / `## ` | node / subnode | `# fn name(...)` is a function node |
| `### ` and deeper | text | heading inside prose |
| `* ` / `+ ` | choice | the space is required |
| `---` alone | gather | must follow a choice (E120) |
| `-> ` | divert | |
| `~ ` | assignment or call | |
| `!name` | directive | `!combat` today; `![` is not a directive |
| `{` | text or block header | rule in 5.7 |
| anything else | text | but see directive bodies below |

There is one exception to "the first characters decide everything". Inside the indented block of a directive the classification changes: a line is an exit name followed by either `-> target` or `[label](#target)` plus optional follow-on text, and anything else is an error (E152). This is the only place where indentation changes what a line means, and it is why directives are a closed list rather than an extension point.

### 18.3 Error codes

Errors abort compilation. Every message carries file, line, column and the offending text. The codes are stable: tools may match on them, and books may reference them in their build setup.

| Code | Error |
|---|---|
| E010 | Frontmatter missing, malformed, or not at the top of the file |
| E011 | Unknown key or malformed declaration in the frontmatter, or a function node carrying `{#id}` |

| E161 | Fact missing a field its source requires |
| E162 | `fixed` value or `fallback` outside the declared `range:` |
| E163 | Fact reading a later-declared fact, or a cycle among facts |
| E164 | Assignment to a fact |
| E165 | `place()` with an unknown id |
| E166 | Place `enter:` naming an unknown node |
| E167 | Event without `do:` |
| E168 | Event with both `once:` and `every:` |
| E169 | Fact expression that is not pure: dice, or a call that changes state |
| E170 | Fact name colliding with a stat or variable |
| E171 | `places.variable:` naming something that is not a declared stat |
| E172 | `holds:` on a fact that is not supplied from outside |
| E173 | `due` outside the `do:` of a scheduled event |
| E180 | An image line that is not `![alt](file)` |
| E181 | An image inside a sentence rather than on a line of its own |
| E182 | An image without alt text |
| E183 | An image path that is a URL, or that leaves the book's directory |
| E184 | An image file that does not exist |

### 18.4 Test suite

Every example in this document is a test case. Each error code needs at least one file that triggers it and one near-miss that must not, so the compiler stays honest in both directions.

## 19. Linter

As an author you meet the linter as a friendly proofreader: it points at things that are probably mistakes, without stopping you.

Warnings do not abort compilation, which is the key difference to section 18. `--strict` turns them into errors, and CI uses `--strict`. The codes are stable, just like the error codes, so tools can match on them.

| Code | Rule | Level |
|---|---|---|
| L001 | Node unreachable from `start` | warning |
| L002 | Node reachable but with no path to any `-> END` | warning |
| L003 | Choice that can never appear (condition statically false) | warning |
| L004 | Sticky choice in a node with no other exit | warning |
| L005 | Node id derived from the title rather than declared | warning |
| L006 | Variable written but never read, or read but never written | warning |
| L007 | Enemy declared but never fought | info |
| L008 | Item taken but never tested with `has()`, or tested but never granted | warning |
| L009 | Code word remembered but never tested, or tested but never set | warning |
| L010 | Stat declared but never used | info |
| L011 | Line longer than 80 characters in the source | info |
| L012 | Choice text duplicated within one node | warning |
| L013 | Node with more than seven choices | info |
| L014 | `death.goto` unreachable by any other route (dead-end check) | info |
| L015 | Prose after an unconditional divert (unreachable text) | warning |
| L016 | Item declared but never granted anywhere | warning |
| L017 | `strings:` key left at its English default while others are overridden | warning |
| L018 | Consumable without `effect:`, or `effect:` on a non-consumable | warning |
| L019 | A node a translation overrides, so its state is language-specific | info |
| L020 | A choice whose condition rolls dice, so it flickers between visits | warning |
| L021 | Event that can never fire: its threshold exceeds the longest path | warning |
| L022 | Event whose assignment is never read | warning |
| L023 | Fact never read anywhere | info |
| L024 | Fact depending on a variable that is never written | warning |
| L025 | Content unreachable when every host fact takes its fallback | info, warning on an output with no host |
| L026 | Divert into a place's `enter:` node without setting the index | warning |
| L027 | Recurring event without `max_catchup:` | info |
| L028 | Gather diverting back into its own node while every choice can run out | warning |
| L029 | Every choice in a node can run out, and taking one leads back into it | warning |

Three of these are deliberately conservative. L003 folds literals and fixed
facts, never variables, so it reports the condition it can prove false and
stays quiet about the rest. L004 speaks up only for a node that changes
nothing and offers exactly one sticky, unconditional choice. A resting place
that advances the clock has earned its button, because every press is a
boundary (11.1). And L015 sees prose standing after an unconditional divert
in the same block, not text orphaned in subtler ways. Each is exact about
what it saw, never about what the author meant, the same bargain L026
strikes in 13.2. L011 reports once per file, naming the first long line,
because prose written one line per paragraph would otherwise drown the list.

L008 and L009 are the ones that actually catch bugs in a gamebook: a key that is never granted, a code word that is never set. Both need the whole book to judge, so they run after resolution across all namespaces.

Beyond the warnings, the linter also emits a **reachability report**: node count, unreachable nodes, endings found, longest and shortest path from start to an ending, counted over choices without evaluating conditions. That report is the closest thing to proofreading a branching book.

Two of the warnings above lean on that same walk. The reachability walk behind the report is run a second time with every host fact at its `fallback:`, and L025 reads the difference between the two runs. The report itself carries the numbers of the first run: a reader with no host gets a smaller book, and saying so is the warning's job, not the report's. A book whose good ending needs a host is a book that quietly loses content when it is played as one file, which is why L025 is the one check whose level depends on what is being built. L021 needs nothing new beyond the first run: the longest path answers the question a branching book cannot be proofread for, whether the relief that was scheduled for turn three hundred can arrive at all.

L021 stays narrow. Only an event counted against `turns()` with a literal
threshold is checked, because a threshold that depends on the reader is not a
thing a static longest path can be compared against.

L028 and L029 are the same trap seen from two sides. L028 is the node that
sends itself back: choices, then a gather, then a divert home. L029 is the node
the reader walks back into from somewhere else, which is the commoner shape and
the harder one to see while writing. Both ask one question: once every choice
here is spent, is there still a way on? What makes the difference is a sticky
choice with no condition, which is why the warning asks for exactly that and
not for fewer once-only choices.

L029 only warns where the return is one nothing can close, through a divert or
through a sticky unconditional choice. A way back through a condition may be
exactly the way that is gone by the time it matters, and warning about it would
be a guess. Its walk starts at the targets rather than at the node, because a
choice that ends the story cannot strand anybody.

Two checks live in the runtime rather than the linter, because no static walk
can reach them. A divert chain is finite: one transition may pass through a
handful of nodes on its way to the page the reader ends up on (11.1), and a
book that has not settled after a hundred of them is looping. The runtime
raises an error naming the node it started from, because the same loop left
unbounded ends as a stack overflow, and a stack trace tells an author nothing
about which node to fix.

And a page has to offer something. When a node is entered and neither a choice
nor a fight nor an ending is left, the runtime raises an error naming that
node. E110 asks the same of a book at compile time, but it can only count what
is written. A node whose choices are all once-only passes that check and still
runs out the second time somebody stands in it, and what the reader would see
is a page with no buttons and no way of telling whether the book ended or
broke.

## 20. Change notes

These tables list what each version added, section by section.

### 0.7 to 0.8

0.8 is the version that lets a book live inside a program that is not its
own. Nothing changes in how a book is written. Everything new sits at the
edges.

| Section     | Change                                                                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5.9         | Images built: `![alt](file)` on a line of its own, alt text required, a path that stays inside the book's directory, both halves translated, `@2x` and `@3x` optional beside the base file. |
| 17.1        | The `image` op added to the story JSON. |
| 18.3        | E172 and E180 to E184 added to the error table. |
| 6, 18.1     | Frontmatter expressions are checked against the same scope as the story's (E130 to E133): a potion that healed a stat nobody declared now fails the compile instead of reaching the reader. |
| 7, 20       | `blurb:` added: the back of the book, a language table shown before setup and first page by the export and by `play`, and readable from `meta` by any host. |
| 7, 8        | `combat.down` added to `strings:`: the dying sentence, spoken in the same breath as the blow that fells an enemy, overridable per enemy like the other three. |
| 19, 22      | L025 is an `info` about a book and a `warning` on an output with no host, because a book does not know which output it becomes. |
| 5.2, 19, 22 | L029 added, and with it the runtime error for a node whose choices have all been taken: E110's twin, for what is left rather than for what is written. |
| 20          | Retitled: the web export is one host of several. 20.5 to 20.9 added, with the hosts beyond the browser, the two ways to play, the host protocol, the native bundle, and what a foreign game loop has to know. |
| 10.1, 11.2  | `holds:` added to a host fact: a state stays across boundaries where a duration is consumed. E172 rejects it anywhere else. |
| 6, 12.2     | `due` added: how many firings a scheduled event was owed at this boundary, so an absence can be folded into one firing instead of repeated or dropped. E173 rejects it anywhere else. |
| 15, 20.6    | A refused save says why in fields, and 20.6 says what a host does about a new edition. |
| 7, 8, 17.1  | A `strings:` line is prose, so the alternatives of 5.6 vary what a combat round says, and an enemy may carry a `strings:` block of its own that beats the book's. Their ids are `@strings:<key>:a<n>` and `@enemy:<id>:<key>:a<n>`, and `config.strings` holds parts rather than a plain string. |
| 16.1        | A held host value rides in the save, so a reader comes back to the world they left. |
| 20 to 23    | Export, hosts, the runtime API and the host protocol moved to `HOSTS.md`. An author needs none of them, and two hosts are built against them, so they have a document of their own. The open points went with them. What sections 22 said about L021, L025, L028 and L029 that was a rule rather than a reason now stands in 19. |
| 6, 15       | `turns_since()` removed. It never returned turns since anything: the save records which nodes have been seen, not when, so the call answered with the total turn count or `-1`. An event on `counter: 'turns()'`, or a variable the book sets itself, does what it promised. |
| 23          | Images, L025, the catch-up mode and the new-edition question leave the open points; what stays of 23.4 is what an alt text owes a map. |
| 5.7         | A blank line ends a chain of `{ }` headers, so two blocks meant to stand on their own no longer swallow each other; `{ else }` stays with the chain above it. Before, a first true header silenced every block below it down to the next line that was not a header. |
| 4.3, 15, 17.1 | Choice and alternative ids carry the namespace in a multi-file book: `crypt.chamber:c0`, not `chamber:c0`. Two chapters with a node of the same name shared one count before, so a once-only choice taken in one vanished from the other. A save from before keeps its other fields, and its once-only choices of a multi-file book are offered again. |

### 0.6 to 0.7

| Section     | Change                                                                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2           | Principles 7 to 9 added, and section 9 with the test behind them.     |
| 6           | `place(id)` added to the built-in functions.                           |
| 7           | `facts:`, `events:` and `places:` added to the book-wide declarations, and therefore to what E012 rejects in a chapter file. |
| 15          | `host`, `facts` and `events` added to the save; 15.1 states that a checkpoint omits `facts`. |
| 17.1        | `config` gains `facts`, `events` and `places`.                         |
| 18.1        | Fact and event expressions are parsed in step 2, with the other frontmatter expressions. |
| 18.3        | E160 to E171 added to the error table.                                 |
| 19          | L021 to L028 added; the reachability walk is repeated with host facts at their fallbacks, and L025 reads the difference. |
| 20.1        | `advance` and `facts` added to the runtime API.                        |
| 20.4        | `play` gains `--host` to supply host values per boundary; `simulate` takes the same flag as its policy for how counters and `elapsed` advance per turn, without which no scheduled content is ever tested. |
